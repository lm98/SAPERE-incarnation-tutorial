#First, we specify the incarnation the simulator should use
incarnation: sapere

# Then we need to choose a network model
network-model:
  type: ConnectWithinDistance # Link every node with any node withing distance X
  parameters: [0.5] # The distance

# Determine the shape of the network, in this case it is a Grid
deployments:
  type: Grid
  parameters: [-5,-5,5,5,0.25,0.25,0,0]
  contents: # define additional content of the network
    - in:
        type: Rectangle # we define a rectangle inside our grid network in which we will insert some molecule
        parameters: [-1,-1,1,1]
      molecule: ball
  programs:
    -
      - time-distribution: 1 # a markovian event with rate 1
        program: > # if the node has the ball, it passes it to a random neighbor
          {ball} --> +{ball}
